        Dear Annie, <br />

Here I am, miles away, penning down these words, yet it feels as if you're here, <br /> your presence carried in whispers of the breeze. <br /><br />

Your words resonate within me like a canvas painted with our shared  moments and dreams  <br /> awaiting their bloom.  Your essence, your laughter, your smile—these thoughts <br />  console me, keeping me company through the miles. <br /><br />

In the quiet of night, under the moon,  thoughts of you bring solace. I  envision that <br /> beautiful smile and the sparkle in your eyes. Your laughter, a melody that soothes my <br /> soul, echoing through the distance, evoking a dance of joy in my heart.<br /><br />

Every word you've shared resides deeply within me. Your love, trust,  vulnerabilities— <br />I cherish every facet of your being. I promise to stand  not just in the luminous moments <br /> but also in the shadows where doubts linger. Our love will be a constant,  guiding us <br /> back to the warmth of each other’s arms. <br /><br />

It's those simple, endearing moments together—the intimacy of shared  weariness, finding <br /> comfort in our presence, and cuddling and wrapped in  blankets on a chilly night—that <br /> I yearn for the most.<br /><br />

You, my love, are my beacon of hope and happiness. Though distance  separates us, my <br /> love for you will always be more. Each passing day will   draw us closer to being wrapped <br /> in each other's arms, bodies  weaved in warmth.<br /><br />

Reflect on this—in this vast universe, our paths converged, our hearts  intertwined.  <br /> You're my serendipity, my love, and I'm endlessly grateful  that our souls found their <br /> way to each other amidst this beautiful chaos.<br /><br />

With all the love in my heart,<br />
Ansh
